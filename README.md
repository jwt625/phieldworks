# PHIELDWORKS — first playable outpost

A desktop-browser factory experiment about turning an industrial network into a controlled wave system. Build a second emitter branch, tune its phase, clear a resource frontier, and commission a reusable outpost.

## Run

Use Node.js 22.12+ (tested here with Node 23.7) and npm.

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:5173**. No API key, account, backend, or external service is required. The game uses generated assets bundled locally, including blended terrain and production/crawler animations. Click Tutorial for the guided first outpost. The development server binds to localhost.

```sh
npm test              # simulation and world tests
npm run build         # TypeScript check + production bundle in dist/
npm run preview       # serve the production build locally
npm run test:browser  # end-to-end browser tests
```

Browser tests use installed Google Chrome at its standard macOS path when available. Otherwise run `npx playwright install chromium` once to install Playwright's browser. Test artifacts are written under test-results/ and are ignored by Git.

## First objective

Open **Technology** in the header to inspect the proposed progression. The research map supports cursor-anchored wheel zoom and drag-to-pan, and **Fit tree** frames the whole graph; the minimap recenters the camera on double-click (including a macOS trackpad double-tap). **Research** shows 27 technology nodes with individually linked unlocks. **Items & equipment** draws the concrete recipe and equipment graph: 99 resources, manufactured items, machines/tooling and operating capabilities, connected by 551 prerequisite, unlock, ingredient, producer, service, science and milestone edges. Enable **Dev: full tree** to inspect all 126 nodes. Search for an item, follow its inputs and consumers, or choose the complete ingredient ancestry/all-connections views. This is a design preview: proposed recipes and research spending are not implemented. See the [design](DevLog/007-technology-tree-design.md), [complete item/equipment specification and branch diagrams](DevLog/009-production-dependencies.md), and [animation plan](DevLog/008-animation-production-plan.md). All 27 planned technology nodes now have generated illustrations in the panel. The [canonical art gallery](assets/technology/nodes/index.html) also previews nine animation candidates and a four-item sheet. All 16 planned source corrections are saved, with explicit review outcomes in the [production tracker](DevLog/014-asset-production-tracker.md); several sheets still need direction and anchor corrections. Animation candidates are not integrated into the world. Run `npm run docs:progression` to regenerate the catalog diagrams after editing the design data.

The expedition starts with a working extractor, assembler, power unit, reference source, junction, emitter, and dump. Resources are finite. The starter assembler produces replacement construction parts automatically.

## Tranche A status (2026-09-13)

The local precision-cell slice is implemented and playable: build a `Fabrication cell`, assign exactly two powered emitters plus a tuner, run an 8-second batch, read the useful/guard forecast, qualify three accepted cycles and capture/deploy an independently controlled copy. Records are local (targets/domains/qualifications/process jobs) with a `version:4` save and v1–v3 migration; controls use one bounded tuner trial per world step; blueprints are selection-based and transactional. The cell still uses a clearly labeled `FAB CELL / PLACEHOLDER` because reviewed art is not integrated (A-09–A-11 remain gated). Automated checkpoint: 115 headless tests, 27 browser scenarios and the production build pass; `scripts/benchmark-two-cells.ts` reports two qualified cells stepping in real time on this machine. A human playtest and explicit visual review of the cell states are still open.

1. Open **Tutorial** for the guided route. Inspect the reserve ore patch and assembler. Build a **perimeter sentry at (22, 10)** and wire generator BUS OUT → sentry POWER IN. Its 8-tile range covers the eastern field branches. The first powered sentry starts a 30-second grace period; afterward sustained stray field can agitate crawlers. Add defenses as your outpost grows.
2. Build a **phase tuner at (17, 12)** and a **second emitter at (20, 12)**. Choose **Wire**, then connect the generator **BUS OUT** to the emitter **POWER IN**. The map hint displays cursor coordinates.
3. Select **Field link**. Connect junction **D** (lower-right port) to tuner **IN**, then tuner **OUT** to the new emitter **IN**.
4. Inspect the tuner. Adjust relative phase while watching **On target**. More than **32 field units** damages the armored organism; mismatched phase sends more radiation elsewhere.
5. Enable **Automatic phase control** to follow thermal drift. Clear the target and unlock the crystal deposit.
6. Run the **20-second acceptance test**, then record a blueprint. Build a generator and extractor near the frontier crystal, and wire their power ports to harvest it.
7. Accumulate the blueprint cost shown in the commissioning panel (**88 assemblies** with one sentry in the suggested layout). Pan east and place it near **(38, 3)** over the remote ore patch. Other configurations have different costs/footprints and may require another location. Placed modules need new local tuning and commissioning.

The field manual (`?`) is available in-game. **1–9** select buildings; **R** rotates a build or disconnected machine; **D** toggles cardinal/diagonal routing while a transport tool or route edit is active; **B** toggles nominal bend radius 0/0.5; click terrain between source and destination ports to add waypoints; click an installed route to select it, then **Edit waypoints** and click terrain to reshape it in place (direct path, profile and radius buttons included); **Esc/right click** cancels; **Space** pauses; **F** toggles the field overlay; **mouse wheel** zooms; **middle mouse/Alt-drag/WASD/arrow keys** pan; **Home** recenters; **Q** cancels construction or picks the inspected machine. The minimap supports click/drag and arrow-key navigation; **Map** fits the whole sector, and **+ / −** zoom. Click machines, deposits or creatures to inspect them. The selected object appears in the sidebar. Equipment supports disconnect, repair and recovery actions. **Diagnostics** exposes current faults, remedies, object location, a live telemetry trend and detected/resolved/action history, with a copyable report; **Tutorial** replays onboarding. The field manual also closes when its backdrop is clicked. The inspector scrolls independently of the map.

Save/Load uses this browser's local storage. New expedition replaces the running world but preserves the manual save. Save schema v3 preserves wildlife behavior/exposure, defense readiness, the grace timer, event history, machinery orientation, route geometry, in-flight inventory, link identities, and blueprint. V2 saves gain an initially peaceful ecology. V1 saves migrate to grid routes and explicit wires when the old layout has sufficient port clearance; otherwise loading reports an invalid save. Loading restores machinery, routes, inventory, and blueprint; qualification must be re-tested. Time does not advance while the tab is hidden or a modal is open.

## Implemented simulation

- Renderer-independent fixed-step world, resource inventories, recipe consumption, construction costs, material belts with discrete packets, and explicit grid power wires.
- Half-tile grid routes with physical port positions/normals, obstacle avoidance, optional diagonals, and quarter-turn footprints. Belts travel at 2 tiles/s with half-tile spacing and receiver backpressure; disconnecting a loaded belt converts its packets to scrap.
- Installed routes are selectable and editable in place: re-routing preserves link identity, endpoints and profile, validates atomically, and re-clamps in-flight packets to the new length.
- Connected-component power allocation: generators share supply over wired components and serve loads in stable build order, so an overload isolates only the excess loads instead of shutting the whole bus down. A per-wire capacity ledger flags overloaded feeds.
- Diagnostics expose active faults with remedies plus a live telemetry trend (target power, heat) and a copyable report, without hiding baseline errors.
- Complex-amplitude, bidirectional port network: matched sources, unitary four-port hybrids, tuners, weak emitter reflections, lossy propagation, and absorptive terminations.
- Small dense pivoted solve of the scattering network per independent source group; powers add between independent groups.
- Route-length phase and attenuation plus an effective bend-radius penalty. The ledger separates propagation loss and bend radiation without double-counting link loss.
- Explicit source/heat/radiation/open-port/link-loss ledger. Singular networks fail with a diagnostic, not NaN propagation.
- Phase-sensitive bounded target-mode projection, thermal drift, local search phase control, target damage, trips, destructive overheating, and repairs.
- Deterministic moving crawlers, field-source investigation, obstacle avoidance, gated aggression, equipment damage and powered perimeter sentries. The armored frontier guardian stays anchored.
- Acceptance testing and blueprint replication with fresh identities and local qualification requirements.

## Deliberate limits

This is a short first-loop prototype, not the balanced 30–45 minute scenario or a full factory game. Electrical wires use generator-to-load routes; healthy generators in the same wired component share 240 units and serve loads in stable build order, so an overload isolates the excess loads rather than the whole bus. Fuel, wire resistance, poles, and true multi-source buses remain abstracted. Assemblies and mined crystal enter shared stock; ore travels on belts. Paths persist as half-tile segments, but route construction costs, individual segment deletion, inserters, splitters, and bridges remain future work. Crossings and shared runs represent insulated/separate layers and never create implicit junctions. One source supplies the initial coherent group. Tile phase is a compressed effective model, not literal optical path length. The target model is a normalized mode projection, not a full array-factor/diffraction simulation; visual beams and focus rings are illustrative diagnostics. There is no pulse dispersion, partial coherence, stochastic environmental coupling, ecology growth, or FDTD yet.

Placement, save loading and solving now share a 256-field-port cap, with 120 machines. The mismatch is fixed, but connected factories with automatic control still exceed the performance budget. See [connected-world measurements and P0.1](DevLog/015-connected-world-validation.md). Equipment uses separately redrawn four-view atlas frames, with fixed camera and lighting. Presentation mappings accept dedicated sheets, scale and offsets; canvas rotation is not used. The generator returned opaque RGB sheets, so this pass uses matte art and lighten compositing, which can show terrain through dark details. Extractor/assembler loops and crawler gait use dedicated frame atlases; source rectangles correct uneven generated row spacing. True alpha cutouts, smoother registered motion and final port-to-art alignment remain polish tasks. Bend radii are effective parameters on polylines, not exact arc geometry or calibrated material physics; damaged equipment is indicated by opacity/status, not unique wreck sprites. Blueprint capture currently includes the entire outpost. Human playtesting and larger-network performance work remain necessary.

## Current development checkpoint

[Tranche A execution package](DevLog/019-tranche-a-plan.md) now specifies the first precision cell at file level: local simulation/save contracts, coding TODOs, asset job manifest, and cached technical references. It is planning only; numerical defaults await the no-cheat gameplay fixture. Validate the package offline with `node scripts/validate-tranche-a-plan.mjs`. The [first cell asset review](assets/planning/tranche-a-review.html) now contains three candidates, measured alpha results and size/terrain comparisons. Serve it through Vite; production registration remains pending.

[Fusion energy planning](DevLog/018-fusion-energy-roadmap.md) adds energy alongside manufacturing and propulsion, sharing equipment families and research across all three. Sustained fusion power is planned as a final-launch requirement, with manufactured fuel cartridges for the initial fuel economy. Experimental ignition and net electricity are separate milestones; these systems are not implemented.

The next gameplay direction is documented in [016 — coherence, industry and lightsail design](DevLog/016-coherence-industry-and-lightsail-design.md): field-assisted manufacturing, local controller/target/qualification domains, specialized wave transport, two beam/sail progression tracks, and a cleaner menu-based HUD. [017 — implementation tranches](DevLog/017-industrial-gameplay-tranches.md) replaces the earlier queue ordering with a first precision-cell slice followed by network foundations, research, regional industry and a sail demonstrator. These are plans, not implemented features; campaign-setting and pacing preferences remain provisional.

The earlier detailed contracts and implementation history remain in [012 — coding handoffs](DevLog/012-next-coding-handoffs.md), mapped to the new tranches in 017. [013 — verification review](DevLog/013-verification-review.md) records visual findings, the overload experiment and capacity benchmarks. [014 — asset production tracker](DevLog/014-asset-production-tracker.md) records saved sources, correction status and the resume order.
